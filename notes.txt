The Stable Linux Kernel Tree, Delivering a Stable Platform on a
Constantly Moving Base

The Linux kernel development process has had a "stable" kernel branch
for much of its lifespan. But, for the past 5 years, that branch has
looked much different from what people consider "stable".

This talk will go into how the different branches of the Linux kernel
are developed, the reasoning and rules that govern the stable kernel
branches, and why companies can, and should, rely and contribute to them
in order to build and support their products.
