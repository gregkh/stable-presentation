The Stable Linux Kernel Tree, Delivering a Stable Platform on a
Constantly Moving Base

The Linux kernel development process has had a "stable" kernel branch
for much of its lifespan. But, for the past 5 years, that branch has
looked much different from what people consider "stable".

This talk will go into how the different branches of the Linux kernel
are developed, the reasoning and rules that govern the stable kernel
branches, and why companies can, and should, rely and contribute to them
in order to build and support their products.

I'll tell you what the problem is: I don't think you'll find anybody to do
the parallell "only trivial patches" tree. They'll go crazy in a couple of
weeks. Why? Because it's a _damn_ hard problem. Where do you draw the
line? What's an acceptable patch? And if you get it wrong, people will
complain _very_ loudly, since by now you've "promised" them a kernel that
is better than the mainline. In other words: there's almost zero glory,
there are no interesting problems, and there will absolutely be people who
claim that you're a dick-head and worse, probably on a weekly basis.

Anybody?

Well, I'm one person who has said that this would be a very tough
problem to solve.  And hey, I like tough problems, so I'll volunteer to
start this.  If I burn out, I'll take the responsibility of finding
someone else to take it over.
